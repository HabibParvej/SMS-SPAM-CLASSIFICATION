# SPAM SMS Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a machine learning solution for classifying SMS messages as spam or non-spam. The project involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, and training a classification model.

## Features
- **Preprocessing**: Removal of stopwords, punctuation, and normalization of text data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Techniques such as TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words.
- **Model Training**: Includes popular machine learning algorithms for classification.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SPAM_SMS.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SPAM_SMS
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook SPAM_SMS.ipynb
```

## Dataset
Ensure that the dataset (e.g., `spam_sms.csv`) is placed in the same directory as the notebook. The dataset should have columns for the text messages and their respective labels.

## Results
The notebook includes visualizations and performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of the trained model.

## Contributions
Feel free to submit pull requests to enhance the project.
